# CML


MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 9.0.1 (R2016a). 
2. imatinibGUI.m is the main form to run the application.


This application provides evidence about the success of the design, implementation, and testing of the personalized medicine support system for CML patients. It guides decision makers as they select the best TKI therapy for CML patients. From [1], using the predictive model is sufficient to prescribe imatinib. However, it is important that conflicts generated by the existing score systems be handled, and if clinicians would like to identify TKI risk groups, they should use the combine prognostic model outcome; the high-risk group should also be closely monitored and may need a combination of TKIs. 
We recommend validating the use of the personalized medicine support system. The results of an ongoing clinical trial will provide additional information about the impact of our system on clinical decision making.
